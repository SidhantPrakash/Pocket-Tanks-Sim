# Pocket-Tanks-Sim
###### Pocket Tank Sim is an interactive single player game based on survival of a pocket sized tank in a war zone.
###### It is easy to learn and fun to play but the twist in the game is that rather than the tank attacking the enemies, it actually tries to defend itself by deflecting the bomb away using the deflector on the top of the pocket sized tank.
###### In this version of the game there is a depiction of a single bomb which keeps on deflecting in the war zone.
###### It is necessary to deflect the bomb and not leave the bomb to drop on the ground.
###### The moment the bomb drops on the floor the game is over.
###### The game is built in C programming language.
###### It uses the graphic library files to design, color, and animate different geometrical curves and shapes.
###### It also uses the standard I/O library files to perform standard input and output commands.
###### The time control of the animation, wherever required, is handled using dos library files.
